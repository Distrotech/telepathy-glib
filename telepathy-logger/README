Telepathy-Logger
================

tp-logger is a headless Observer client that logs information received by the
Telepathy framework. It features pluggable backends to log different sorts of
messages, in different formats.

tp-logger features a Telepathy-style D-Bus API to expose logs and interesting
information related to logging (most frequent contacts, etc.). It also provides
a GLib-compatible client API for making bulk log requests (e.g. for display
logs in applications without having to provide lots of information over D-Bus).

TPL is currently under development, please refer to
http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Logger for more information.

Bugs should be filed at http://bugs.freedesktop.org/ under the product
`Telepathy' and the category `logger'.

Telepathy discussion takes place on the Telepathy mailing list
<telepathy@lists.freedesktop.org> or on irc.freenode.net/#telepathy
