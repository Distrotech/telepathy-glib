== When testing ==

When testing, be sure to set TPL_TEST_MODE enviromental variable.
A log base for testing is placed in TPL_TEST_LOG_DIR.

== When writing code ==

If an object should behave in a different way, depending on whether it is in a
testing enviroment or not, you should rely on the present of TPL_TEST_MODE
variable.

TplLogStore interface defines a "testmode" property which when set TRUE will set
the log store supporting it they are in a testing enviroment.
Add support for this property in case the log store needs it.

TplLogManager will set this property automatically on any automatically added
store, when TPL_TEST_MODE is set.
