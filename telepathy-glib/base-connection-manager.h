 * @flags: Some combination of TP_CONN_MGR_PARAM_FLAG_foo
 * @def: Default value, as a (const gchar *) for string parameters, or
         using #GINT_TO_POINTER or #GUINT_TO_POINTER for integer parameters
 * @offset: Offset of the parameter in the opaque data structure. The member
 *          at that offset is expected to be a gint, guint, (gchar *) or
 *          gboolean, depending on @gtype. Alternatively, this may be
 *          G_MAXSIZE, which means the parameter is obsolete, and is

 *          value before it is written into the opaque data structure
 * @filter_data: Arbitrary opaque data intended for use by the filter function
 * @setter_data: Arbitrary opaque data intended for use by the setter function
 *               instead of or in addition to @offset.
 *
 * Structure representing a connection manager parameter, as accepted by
 * RequestConnection.
