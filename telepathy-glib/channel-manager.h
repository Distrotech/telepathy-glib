 * the appropriate argument).
 *
 * If the implementation does not want to handle the request, it should return
 * %FALSE to allow the request to be offered to another channel manager.
 *
 * Implementations may assume the following of @request_properties:
 *
 * <itemizedlist>
 *   <listitem>
 *      the ChannelType property is present, and is a (const gchar *)
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>
 *     the TargetHandleType property is a valid #TpHandleType, if present
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>

 *     if TargetHandleType is not None, TargetHandle is a valid #TpHandle of
 *     that #TpHandleType
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>
 *     the TargetID property is not present (if supplied by the client, it will
 *     be converted to a TargetHandle before being passed to this function)
 *   </listitem>

 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @manager will handle this request, else %FALSE.
