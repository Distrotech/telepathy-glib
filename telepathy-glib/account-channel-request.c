 * @title: TpAccountChannelRequest
 * @short_description: Object used to request a channel from a #TpAccount
 *
 * A #TpAccountChannelRequest object is used to request a channel using the
 * ChannelDispatcher. Once created, use one of the create or ensure async
 * method to actually request the channel.
 *
 * Note that each #TpAccountChannelRequest object can only be used to create
 * one channel. You can't call a create or ensure method more than once on the
 * same #TpAccountChannelRequest.
 *
 * Once the channel has been created you can use the
 * TpAccountChannelRequest::re-handled: signal to be notified when the channel
 * has to be re-handled. This can be useful for example to move its window
 * to the foreground, if applicable.
 *
 * Using this object is appropriate for most channel types.
 * For a contact search channel, use tp_contact_search_new_async() instead.
 *
 * Since: 0.11.12
