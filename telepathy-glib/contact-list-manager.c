/**
 * SECTION:contact-list-manager
 * @title: TpContactListManager
 * @short_description: channel manager for ContactList channels
 *
 * This class represents a connection's contact list (roster, buddy list etc.)
 * inside a connection manager. It can be used to implement the ContactList
 * D-Bus interface on the Connection.
 *
 * In versions of the Telepathy D-Bus Interface Specification prior to
 * 0.19.UNRELEASED, this functionality was provided as a collection of
 * individual ContactList channels. As a result, this object also implements
 * the #TpChannelManager interface, so that it can provide those channels.
 * The channel objects are internal to this object, and not considered to be
 * part of the API.
