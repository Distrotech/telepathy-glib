 *
 * Many Telepathy Channel objects can be seen as representing groups or
 * sets of contacts. The Telepathy specification represents this by a common
 * interface, Group. This section documents the auto-generated GInterface
 * used to implement the Group interface.
 *
 * Contacts can be in four states:
 *
 * * in the group (the "members" set)
 *
 * * "local pending" (waiting to be added to the group by the local client
 *   calling AddMembers())
 *
 * * "remote pending" (waiting to be added to the group by some other
 *   action, probably by someone else)
 *
 * * no relationship with the group at all
 *
 * For instance, chatrooms implement the Group interface. Contacts in the
 * chatroom are members, and contacts who we've invited to the group, or
 * contacts who've requested permission to join, are remote pending. If the
 * local user has been invited by another contact, they will appear in the
 * local-pending set until they accept or decline the invitation.
