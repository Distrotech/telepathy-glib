 * @short_description: Macros using caching factory functions to get
 *    dbus-glib specialized GTypes
 *
 * dbus-glib's built-in factory functions for specialized GTypes need to do
 * a fair amount of parsing on their arguments, so these macros are provided
 * to avoid that. Each macro expands to a call to a function which caches
 * the GType, so it only ever has to call into dbus-glib once.
 *
 * tp_dbus_specialized_value_slice_new() is also provided.
