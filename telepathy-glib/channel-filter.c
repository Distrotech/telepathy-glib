 * SECTION:channel-filter
 * @title: TpChannelFilter
 * @short_description: a filter matching certain channels
 * @see_also: #TpBaseClient, #TpSimpleApprover, #TpSimpleHandler,
 *  #TpSimpleObserver
 *
 * Telepathy clients are notified about "interesting" #TpChannels
 * by the Channel Dispatcher. To do this efficiently, the clients have
 * lists of "channel filters", describing the channels that each client
 * considers to be "interesting".
 *
 * In telepathy-glib, these lists take the form of lists of #TpChannelFilter
 * objects. Each #TpChannelFilter matches certain properties of the channel,
 * and the channel dispatcher dispatches a channel to a client if that
 * channel matches any of the filters in the client's list:
 *
 * |[
 * channel is interesting to this client = (
 *     ((channel matches property A from filter 1) &&
 *      (channel matches property B from filter 1) && ...)
 *      ||
 *     ((channel matches property P from filter 2) &&
 *      (channel matches property Q from filter 2) && ...)
 *      || ...)
 * ]|
 *
 * An empty list of filters does not match any channels, but a list
 * containing an empty filter matches every channel.
 *
 * To construct a filter, either create an empty filter with
 * tp_channel_filter_new(), or create a pre-populated filter with
 * certain properties using one of the convenience constructors like
 * tp_channel_filter_new_for_text_chats().
 *
 * After creating a filter, you can make it more specific by using
 * methods like tp_channel_filter_require_locally_requested(), if
 * required.
 *
 * Finally, add it to a #TpBaseClient using
 * tp_base_client_add_observer_filter(),
 * tp_base_client_add_approver_filter() and/or
 * tp_base_client_add_handler_filter() (depending on the type
 * of client required), and release the filter object with g_object_unref().
 *
 * If you would like the #TpBaseClient to act on particular channels in
 * more than one role - for instance, an Approver for Text channels which
 * is also a Handler for Text channels - you can add the same
 * #TpChannelFilter object via more than one method.
 *
 * Once you have added a filter object to a #TpBaseClient, you may not
 * modify it further.
