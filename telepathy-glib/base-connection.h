 * @create_channel_factories: Create an array of channel factories for this
 *  Connection. Must be set by subclasses to a non-%NULL value.
 * @get_unique_connection_name: Construct a unique name for this connection
 *  (for example using the protocol's format for usernames). If %NULL (the
 *  default), a unique name will be generated. Subclasses should usually
 *  override this to get more obvious names, to aid debugging and prevent
 *  multiple connections to the same account.
 * @connecting: If set by subclasses, will be called just after the state
 *  changes to CONNECTING. May be %NULL if nothing special needs to happen.
 * @connected: If set by subclasses, will be called just after the state
 *  changes to CONNECTED. May be %NULL if nothing special needs to happen.
 * @disconnected: If set by subclasses, will be called just after the state
 *  changes to DISCONNECTED. May be %NULL if nothing special needs to happen.
 * @shut_down: Called after disconnected() is called, to clean up the
 *  connection. Must start the shutdown process for the underlying
 *  network connection, and arrange for tp_base_connection_finish_shutdown()
 *  to be called after the underlying connection has been closed. May not
 *  be left as %NULL.
 * @start_connecting: Asynchronously start connecting - called to implement
 *  the Connect D-Bus method. See #TpBaseConnectionStartConnectingImpl for
 *  details. May not be left as %NULL.
 * @interfaces_always_present: A strv of extra D-Bus interfaces which are
 *  always implemented by instances of this class, which may be filled in
 *  by subclasses. The default is to list no additional interfaces.
 *  Individual instances may detect which additional interfaces they support
 *  and signal them before going to state CONNECTED by calling
 *  tp_base_connection_add_interfaces().

 * The class of a #TpBaseConnection. Many members are virtual methods etc.
 * to be filled in in the subclass' class_init function.
