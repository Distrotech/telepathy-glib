 * @short_description: channel factory creating TpChannel objects
 * @see_also: #TpAutomaticProxyFactory
 *
 * This factory implements the #TpClientChannelFactory interface to create
 * plain #TpChannel objects. Unlike #TpAutomaticProxyFactory, it will
 * not create higher-level subclasses like #TpStreamTubeChannel.
 * The only feature this factory asks to prepare is #TP_CHANNEL_FEATURE_CORE.
 *
 * TpProxy subclasses other than TpChannel are not currently supported.
 *
 * Since: 0.13.2
