/**
 * SECTION:client-channel-factory
 * @title: TpClientChannelFactoryInterface
 * @short_description: an interface for client channel factories
 *
 * Client channel factories are used to create channel proxies. An application
 * wanting to use its own #TpChannel subclass has to implement an object
 * implementing the #TpClientChannelFactoryInterface interface.
 *
 * Once a channel has been created by a factory using
 * tp_client_channel_factory_create_channel(), the caller should then prepare
 * on it the channel features returned by
 * tp_client_channel_factory_dup_channel_features() using
 * tp_proxy_prepare_async().
 *
 * Since: 0.13.2
