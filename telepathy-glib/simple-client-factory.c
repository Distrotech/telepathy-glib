/**
 * SECTION:simple-client-factory
 * @title: TpSimpleClientFactory
 * @short_description: a factory for #TpContact<!-- -->s and plain subclasses
 *  of #TpProxy
 * @see_also: #TpAutomaticClientFactory
 *
 * This factory constructs various #TpProxy subclasses as well as #TpContact,
 * which guarantees that at most one instance of those objects will exist for a
 * given remote object or contact. It also stores the desired features for
 * contacts and each type of proxy.
 *
 * Note that the factory will not prepare the desired features: it is the
 * caller's responsibility to do so. By default, only core features are
 * requested.
 *
 * Currently supported classes are #TpAccount, #TpConnection,
 * #TpChannel and #TpContact. Those objects should always be acquired through a
 * factory or a "larger" object (e.g. getting the #TpConnection from
 * a #TpAccount), rather than being constructed directly.
 *
 * One can subclass #TpSimpleClientFactory and override some of its virtual
 * methods to construct more specialized objects. See #TpAutomaticClientFactory
 * for a subclass which automatically constructs subclasses of #TpChannel for
 * common channel types.
 *
 * An application using its own factory subclass would look like this:
 * |[
 * int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 * {
 *   TpSimpleClientFactory *factory;
 *   TpAccountManager *manager;
 *
 *   factory = my_factory_new ();
 *   manager = tp_account_manager_new_with_factory (factory);
 *   tp_account_manager_set_default (manager);
 *
 *   ...
 *   tp_proxy_prepare_async (manager, am_features, callback, user_data);
 *   ...
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * The call to tp_account_manager_set_default() near the beginning of main()
 * will ensure that any libraries or plugins which also use Telepathy (and call
 * tp_account_manager_dup()) will share your #TpAccountManager.
 *
 * Since: 0.15.5

 *
 * #TpSimpleClientFactory maintains a cache of previously-constructed proxy
 * objects, so the implementations of @create_account,
 * @create_connection, @create_channel, and @create_contact may assume that a
 * new object should be created when they are called. The default
 * implementations create unadorned instances of the relevant classes;
 * subclasses of the factory may choose to create more interesting proxy
 * subclasses.
 *
 * The default implementation of @dup_channel_features returns
 * #TP_CHANNEL_FEATURE_CORE, plus all features passed to
 * tp_simple_client_factory_add_channel_features() by the application.
 * Subclasses may override this method to prepare more interesting features
 * from subclasses of #TpChannel, for instance. The default implementations of
 * the other <function>dup_x_features</function> methods behave similarly.
