/**
 * SECTION:channel-manager
 * @title: TpChannelManager
 * @short_description: interface for creating and tracking channels
 * @see_also: #TpSvcConnection
 *
 * A channel manager is attached to a connection. It carries out channel
 * requests from the connection, and responds to channel-related events on the
 * underlying network connection, for particular classes of channel (for
 * example, incoming and outgoing calls, respectively). It also tracks
 * currently-open channels of the relevant kinds.
 *
 * The connection has an array of channel managers. In response to a call to
 * CreateChannel or RequestChannel, the channel request is offered to each
 * channel manager in turn, until one accepts the request. In a trivial
 * implementation there might be a single channel manager which handles all
 * requests and all incoming events, but in general, there will be multiple
 * channel managers handling different types of channel.
 *
 * For example, at the time of writing, Gabble has a roster channel manager
 * which handles contact lists and groups, an IM channel manager which
 * handles one-to-one messaging, a MUC channel manager which handles
 * multi-user chat rooms, the index of chat rooms and MUC tubes, a media
 * channel manager which handles VoIP calls, and a 1-1 tubes channel manager.
 *
 * Since: 0.7.UNRELEASED
