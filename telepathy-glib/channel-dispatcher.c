 * @short_description: proxy object for the Telepathy channel dispatcher

 * The #TpChannelDispatcher object can be used to communicate with any
 * implementation of the Telepathy ChannelDispatcher service to request
 * new channels.
 */

/**
 * TpChannelDispatcher:
 *
 * The Channel Dispatcher's main D-Bus API is used to request channels,
 * which is done by calling tp_cli_channel_dispatcher_call_create_channel() or
 * tp_cli_channel_dispatcher_call_ensure_channel() as appropriate.
 *
 * The Telepathy Channel Dispatcher is also responsible for responding to new
 * channels and launching client processes to handle them. However, clients
 * that can work with incoming channels do not have to call methods
 * on the channel dispatcher: instead, they must register with the channel
 * dispatcher passively, by taking a bus name starting with
 * %TP_CLIENT_BUS_NAME_BASE and implementing the #TpSvcClient interface.
 * See the Telepathy D-Bus Interface Specification for details.
 *
 * This proxy is usable but incomplete: convenience methods will be added in
 * a later version of telepathy-glib, along with a mechanism similar to
 * tp_connection_call_when_ready().
 *
 * Since: 0.7.UNRELEASED
