 * @title: DTMF dialstring interpreter
 * @short_description: Converts a dialstring into a timed sequence of events
 *
 * Telepathy offers two APIs for DTMF events: user interfaces can either
 * call the StartTone and StopTone methods (appropriate if the user is
 * pressing hardware or on-screen buttons in real time), or call
 * MultipleTones or set InitialTones (appropriate if a stored dialstring
 * is in use).
 *
 * #TpDTMFPlayer provides common code for connection managers that need to
 * turn MultipleTones or InitialTones received from a UI into a sequence of
 * start and stop events for the underlying protocol.
 *
 * Since: 0.13.3
