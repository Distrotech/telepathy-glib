Those are mini tasks still to do. They should be filed against a bug
trucker as soon as TPL will have one:

- dispose/finalize methods
- check input types for callbacks and getters/setters with TPL_IS_... and Co.
- global configuration object (ie disable logging partially or totally,
  choose the logstore, etc)
- understand if direction from tpl_log_entry_text is to be removed 
- make TplObserver a singleton
- move glob_map in tpl-observer.c to a member of TplObserver (singleton)
- understand if TplContact is still useful or can be substitued by a
  simple TpContact
