To run all tests:

  make check

or with coverage info:

  ./configure --enable-compiler-coverage
  make lcov-check

== C tests ==

To run all C tests (assuming the current directory is $top_srcdir):

  make -C tests check-TESTS

To run an individual test:

  make -C tests check-TESTS TESTS=test-handles

To run tests under Valgrind:

  make -C tests check-valgrind

To run an individual test under Valgrind:

  make -C tests check-valgrind TESTS=test-handles

== Twisted tests ==

To run all Twisted tests:

  make check-twisted

To run an individual Twisted test:

  make -C tests/twisted check-twisted TWISTED_TESTS=test-connect.py

or:

  cd tests/twisted
  sh tools/with-session-bus.sh --config-file=tools/tmp-session-bus.conf \
        -- python test-connect.py

To run with debug information:

  make -C tests/twisted check-twisted TWISTED_TESTS=test-connect.py \
        CHECK_TWISTED_VERBOSE=1

or:

  cd tests/twisted
  sh tools/with-session-bus.sh --config-file=tools/tmp-session-bus.conf \
        -- python test-connect.py -v

To debug an individual test you can set one of the following env variable:

  * GABBLE_TEST_VALGRIND : to run Gabble inside valgrind. The report is
    added to tools/gabble-testing.log.
        export GABBLE_TEST_VALGRIND=1

  * GABBLE_TEST_REFDBG : to run Gabble inside refdbg. The report is written
    to tools/refdbg.log. You can change GABBLE_WRAPPER to use an alternative
    refdbg and change REFDBG_OPTIONS to set your own parameters. Example:
        export GABBLE_TEST_REFDBG=1
        export GABBLE_WRAPPER="/path/to/refdbg"
        export REFDBG_OPTIONS="btnum=16"

  * GABBLE_WRAPPER="nemiver" : to run Gabble inside the graphical debugger
    nemiver. You'll be able to set up breakpoints; then hit the "continue"
    button to launch Gabble.

  * GABBLE_TEST_STRACE : to run Gabble inside strace. The report is written
    to tools/strace.log.
        export GABBLE_TEST_STRACE=1


== Jingle tests ==

Various jingle tests run the same tests with different dialects. To only test
certain dialects use the JINGLE_DIALECTS environment variable. Currently
supported are jingle015, jingle031, gtalk03 and gtalk04. For example to only
run generic tests with the two jingle dialects you can do:

  make -C tests/twisted check-twisted  TWISTED_TESTS=jingle/\*.py \
    JINGLE_DIALECTS=jingle015,jingle031
