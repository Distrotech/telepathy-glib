Where to put new tests:

/tests/ if they're simple regression tests that don't touch the session bus

/tests/dbus/ if they touch the session bus
(a temporary session bus will be used)

/tests/tools/ if they're shell scripts that test the code generation tools

To run a single test:
  make -C tests/dbus check TESTS=test-contacts

If you're running a test under a debugger, export TP_TESTS_NO_TIMEOUT=1 to
avoid it being killed for taking too long.

Generate tests coverage report

./configure --enable-compiler-coverage
