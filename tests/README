To run all tests:

  make check

or with coverage info:

  ./configure --enable-compiler-coverage
  make lcov-check

== C tests ==

To run all C tests (assuming the current directory is $top_srcdir):

  make -C tests check-TESTS

To run an individual test:

  make -C tests check-TESTS TESTS=test-handles

To run tests under Valgrind:

  make -C tests check-valgrind

To run an individual test under Valgrind:

  make -C tests check-valgrind TESTS=test-handles

To debug an individual test you can set one of the following env variable:

  * TPL_TEST_VALGRIND : to run Gabble inside valgrind. The report is
    added to tools/tpl-testing.log.
        export TPL_TEST_VALGRIND=1

  * TPL_TEST_REFDBG : to run Gabble inside refdbg. The report is written
    to tools/refdbg.log. You can change TPL_WRAPPER to use an alternative
    refdbg and change REFDBG_OPTIONS to set your own parameters. Example:
        export TPL_TEST_REFDBG=1
        export TPL_WRAPPER="/path/to/refdbg"
        export REFDBG_OPTIONS="btnum=16"

  * TPL_WRAPPER="nemiver" : to run Gabble inside the graphical debugger
    nemiver. You'll be able to set up breakpoints; then hit the "continue"
    button to launch Gabble.

  * TPL_TEST_STRACE : to run Gabble inside strace. The report is written
    to tools/strace.log.
        export TPL_TEST_STRACE=1
