API/Behaviour changes
=====================

 - The library has been split in half. To use high-level APIs, use the
   pkg-config module "telepathy-glib-1" and
   #include <telepathy-glib/telepathy-glib.h>. To use lower-level APIs that
   rely on dbus-glib GTypes or specific D-Bus interfaces, methods or signals,
   also use the pkg-config module "telepathy-glib-1-dbus" and
   #include <telepathy-glib/telepathy-glib-dbus.h>.

 - TpSimpleClientFactory got renamed to TpClientFactory

 - tp_automatic_client_factory_new() now returns a TpSimpleClientFactory*
   for less boring casting.

 - Tp{Basic,Automatic}ProxyFactory and TpClientChannelFactory, as well as all
   related APIs got removed. TpClientFactory and TpAutomaricClientFactory are
   their replacement.

 - tp_simple_{observer,approver,handler}_new() now takes a TpClientFactory as
   first argument, and _new_with_factory() got removed.

 - TpBaseClient lost its "account-manager" property, applications only
   interested by channels does not have to create a full TpAccountManager,
   TpAccount objects will be created only when a channel comes up for that
   account.

 - TpContact now uses GQuark instead of TpContactFeature. This make them
   consistent with TpProxy features.

 - TpAutomaticClientFactory now only has CORE features by default, other
   features must be added explicitly by the user using
   tp_client_factory_add_*_features().

 - TP_CHANNEL_FEATURE_CONTACTS is removed:
   * TpChannel:target-contact and TpChannel:initiator-contact are now prepared
     as part of TP_CHANNEL_FEATURE_CORE;
   * group TpContacts are now prepared as part of TP_CHANNEL_FEATURE_GROUP.

 - TP_CHANNEL_FEATURE_GROUP is not CORE anymore, so must be request explicitly
   to introspect Group interface.

 - Some of the Group APIs of TpChannel has been renamed:
   * tp_channel_group_dup_members_contacts -> tp_channel_group_dup_members;
   * tp_channel_group_dup_local_pending_contacts -> tp_channel_group_dup_local_pending;
   * tp_channel_group_get_local_pending_contact_info -> tp_channel_group_get_local_pending_info;
   * tp_channel_group_dup_remote_pending_contacts -> tp_channel_group_dup_remote_pending;
   * "group-contacts-changed" -> "group-members-changed".
