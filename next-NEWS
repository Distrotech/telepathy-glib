API/Behaviour changes
=====================

 - TpSimpleClientFactory got renamed to TpClientFactory

 - tp_automatic_client_factory_new() now returns a TpSimpleClientFactory*
   for less boring casting.

 - Tp{Basic,Automatic}ProxyFactory and TpClientChannelFactory, as well as all
   related APIs got removed. TpClientFactory and TpAutomaricClientFactory are
   their replacement.

 - tp_simple_{observer,approver,handler}_new() now takes a TpClientFactory as
   first argument, and _new_with_factory() got removed.

 - TpBaseClient lost its "account-manager" property, applications only
   interested by channels does not have to create a full TpAccountManager,
   TpAccount objects will be created only when a channel comes up for that
   account.
