telepathy-logger 0.1.2 (UNRELEASED)
===================================

Dependencies:

* telepathy-glib ≥ 0.11.5
* telepathy-mission-control ≥ 5.4.0 is recommended

telepathy-logger 0.1.1 (2010-02-26)
===================================

The ``brick by brick'' release.

This is the second previous release of the telepathy-logger. You should be aware
that this is a piece of software that is still very much in development,
everything is subject to change.

The idea behind tp-logger is that it will become a generic logging daemon usable
anywhere in Telepathy, with any Telepathy client.

Changes in this release:
 - libtelepathy-logger.pc is now just telepathy-logger.pc
 - asynchronous API has _finish() methods.
 - Fix a crasher in handling MUCs
 - Logger now observes channels that are open when it starts
 - API now includes support for storing favourite contacts in a way that can
   be shared between Telepathy clients

telepathy-logger 0.1.0 (2010-02-24)
===================================

The ``Calamity Ensues'' release

This is the first preview release of the telepathy-logger. You should be aware
that this is a piece of software that is still very much in development,
everything is subject to change.

The idea behind tp-logger is that it will become a generic logging daemon usable
anywhere in Telepathy, with any Telepathy client.

Things that mostly work:

 - logging of text channels into an Empathy style log format using a Telepathy
   Observer client
 - Telepathy-style D-Bus API to retrieve logs (will be extended soon with more
   functionality)
 - libtelepathy-logger API to allow clients to access logs en-masse
 - GConf preferences to control what accounts to log

Things that don't work:

 - existing channels won't be logged when the logger starts
 - preference changes aren't noticed asynchronously

Note that tp-logger won't import your existing logs from Empathy, for the time
being, if you're running it, you are going to end up with two sets of logs,
one from Empathy and one from tp-logger.
