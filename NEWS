telepathy-glib 0.99.1 (2013-09-17)
==================================

The “house of cards” release.

This is a snapshot of the branch that will become telepathy-glib 1.0,
corresponding to telepathy-spec 0.99.1. It is not really usable yet:
we're releasing it to have a fixed point when upgrading connection
managers and other related projects.

See UPGRADING for some notes on what has changed in the API and ABI.
