telepathy-stream-engine 0.5.0 (2008-04-04)
==========================================

* Refactoring to take us closer to having a "stream engine" library, cleaning
  up API of channel/session/stream to allow inheritance.
* Use gconf and auto audio source/sink elements if available.
* Add elements to allow volume control and muting when on non-maemo DSP
  platforms.
* Fix race conditions where multiple stream objects could be created for the
  same CM streams.
* Port to use telepathy-glib instead of libtelepathy, increasing robustness at
  shutdown and against CM crashes.
* Remove fakesink element in video pipeline so the video device will be closed
  when there are no preview windows or video streams.
* Installs to ${libexecdir} now, instead of ${bindir}.
