telepathy-glib 0.99.2 (2013-09-27)
==================================

The “no surprises” release.

This is another snapshot, so that the 'next' branches of telepathy-salut
and telepathy-haze can work.

Dependencies:

• GLib ≥ 2.34 is required

API changes:

• Protocol names may now contain underscores, but not hyphen/minus
  (telepathy-spec 0.99.1 says this is OK).

• Connection manager names may now start with underscores
  (telepathy-spec 0.99.2 says this is OK)

Fixes:

• Merged from telepathy-glib master, see NEWS-0.x

telepathy-glib 0.99.1 (2013-09-17)
==================================

The “house of cards” release.

This is a snapshot of the branch that will become telepathy-glib 1.0,
corresponding to telepathy-spec 0.99.1. It is not really usable yet:
we're releasing it to have a fixed point when upgrading connection
managers and other related projects.

See UPGRADING for some notes on what has changed in the API and ABI.
