=======================
telepathy-stream-engine
=======================

Stream Engine is a Telepathy client that uses Farsight and GStreamer to handle
media streaming channels. It's used as a background process by other Telepathy
clients, rather than presenting any user interface of its own.

Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
applications.

Requirements
============

telepathy-stream-engine requires:
  telepathy-glib <http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/releases/telepathy-glib/>
  Farsight <http://farsight.freedesktop.org/releases/farsight/>
  GStreamer base plugins <http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/>
  GLib, GObject <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glib/>
  libdbus <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/>
  The D-Bus GLib bindings <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib/>

At build time, it also requires:
  GNU make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
  pkg-config <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pkg-config/>
  libxslt, xsltproc <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
  Python <http://www.python.org/>

See configure.ac for full details, including versions required.

Building from Darcs also requires the GNU build system (Autoconf, Automake,
libtool).

Bugs, feature requests and to-do list
=====================================

Versioning policy
=================

We use an "odd/even" versioning scheme where the minor version (the y in
x.y.z) determines stability - stable branches have y even, development
branches have y odd.

Unreleased builds straight from Darcs identify themselves as version
"x.y.z.1". These are compiled with -Werror, so they might stop working
if your gcc version issues more warnings than ours. If this is a problem
for you, use a release tarball.
